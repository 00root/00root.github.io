## Basics
### Print Function
print ()
- Built-in function: can be used without importing it.
- Allows us to print values to the console
- We can invoke it with parentheses.
- We can pass the value we want to print as arguments between the parentheses.
- The backslash \ tells python that the next character has a special meaning(eg. \n)
- Keyword arguments such as **sep** and **end** can be used to format the output.
